# dFastighet Blockchain | Real Estate Smart Contract | Hyperledger Fabric

### [Presentation Slide Deck](https://github.com/lexiddie/d-fastighet-blockchain/blob/main/Slide%20Deck.pdf)

## What is dFastighet?

**dFastighet** is the application for real estate organizations to conduct transactions as Smart Contract using blockchain technology via **Hyperledger Fabric**. Moreover, dFastighet came from the word '**decentralized real estate**' in the **Swedish** Language.

When it comes to real estate transactions, it takes months and significantly slow processes. And it requires third parties or the middlemen like **brokers, banks, and lawyers**. Moreover, it will not eliminate the local government regulations as the guarantors. The real estate transactions will be on the smart contract executed into the Blockchain network with blockchain technology. As a result, it removes **bureaucracy, middlemen, and complete transparency**.

The transactions of the real estate will be able to speed up. **Smart-contract** makes it convenient to bind the digital ownership of the **property**, **documents**, and **contracts** swiftly into the blockchain network. The owner will be protected because their data are inside the blockchain network, and it is impossible to be **tampered** with or **altered**.

## [What is Hyperledger Fabric?](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/what-is-hyperledger-fabric/)

Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source, permissioned blockchain framework, started in 2015 by The Linux Foundation. It is a modular, general-purpose framework that offers unique identity management and access control features, making it suitable for various industrial applications such as track-and-trace of supply chains, trade finance, loyalty and rewards, and clearing and settlement of financial assets.

[Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. Its modular and versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry use cases. It offers a unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving privacy.

## Benefits of Hyperledger Fabric

1. Open Source
2. Permissioned blockchain
3. Governance and Access Control
4. Performance

## Blockchain

The Blockchain is a digitally decentralized ledger, as we so-called data. Its primary technology provides a decentralized network without the trusted third party, secured using cryptography, and regulated under the consensus algorithm.

Blockchain is an immutable and irreversible chain. Moreover, most blockchains are distributed to their chains of the network, which fully peers to peers. Again, those networks are computers that do the computational equation as they are called nodes.

Blockchain provides an independent, tamperproof, transparent new platform to store, transmit securely, and process sensitive and valuable data.

Blockchain is only consisting of a list of validated blocks. Moreover, each block is connecting to its predecessor to the genesis block.

## Private Blockchain | Permissioned Blockchain

Private Blockchain is an innovation-only single organization network to have access and authority over the network. It is a partially decentralized system.

## Technology Stack and Tools

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript
- ExpressJS
- Google Cloud Platform
- Firebase
- Sass
- Docker
- Node.js
- Hyperledger Fabric (Test Network)
- Fabric Contract API
- Fabric Network
- Fabric Client

## Platforms

- **dFastighet App**: is written in JavaScript ES6 using ReactJS for Client-Side Application.
- **dFastighet Chaincode**: is written in JavaScript using Fabric Contract API. It dispatched the information of the business model and logic that govern assets on the blockchain ledger.
- **dFastighet Server**: is written in JavaScript using ExpressJS as a web service to facilitate data from the blockchain network into the client-side platform.

## Project Criteria and Requirements

1. The solution must have a front-end application (e.g., mobile application or web application) that directly interacts with the back-end Hyperledger Fabric platform. Optionally, it must be the web application that acts as a medium between the front-end application and Hyperledger Fabric to facilitate any necessary services.

2. The information must be carefully selected to store in or not in the Blockchain.

3. The solution must demonstrate with at least three organizations. Optionally, each organization can also have a different number of peers.

4. The solution must demonstrate the channel mechanism for peer-to-peer or more than three peers' interactions regarding the application concept.

5. It must be the fabric test network as the development base.

6. It must be demonstrated that when someone with an inconsistent wallet identity tries to request the contract, the system should respond unauthorize.

7. The demonstration of the system architecture illustration, including Hyperledger Fabric network architecture, in detail.

## Project Completions

1. Three Organizations (Org1, Org2, & Org3)
2. Two Channels (Shared Channel and Private Channel)
3. The integrity of data ownership
4. Web App, Web Service, Chaincode Smart-Contract
5. The assets like properties can be added to the blockchain network
6. The assets can be transferred to another owner
7. The previous assets' owners can be traced
